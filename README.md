Overview
The Simple Calculator project is a Python program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also includes advanced mathematical functions such as square, square root, sine, cosine, tangent, logarithms, factorial, and more.
This program is intended to allow users to perform a wide range of calculations interactively via the command line.

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
Advanced Operations:
Square and Square Root of a number.
Power of a number (x^y).
Modulus (remainder of division).
Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent).
Natural logarithm (ln(x)) and Logarithms with a custom base.
Factorial of a number (x!).
History Tracking: Keeps track of all past calculations for review.
Clear History: Option to clear the calculation history.

How to Use
Start the Program: Run the calculator.py script in your Python environment.
Enter a Number: The program will prompt you to enter the first number.
Select an Operation: You will be asked to choose an operation by entering the corresponding number (1-16).
